The basic rendering setup was created with models, lighting, input and a camera I learnt from learnopengl.com.",Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),"I then researched and implemented shaders in GLSL. First, I recreated a Unity shader, with an end result of stormy, stylistic clouds, texturing the skydome which surrounds the player. This shader mainly uses flow maps, a technique introduced by Valve for Portal 2, giving a varying and compelling flow to the clouds.",Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),"The second shader I created was my refractive glass shader, which I implemented based on  the Generic Refraction Simulation chapter in Nvidia\u2019s GPU Gems 2. This detailed how I should create the shader, but without GLSL specifics. Details included: using frame buffers to get a \u201crefraction map\u201d which could be combined with a model\u2019s normal map in order to perturbe the scene behind the model.",Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),"The idea behind the simulation is to use what's behind the bottle as its texture with this texture being distorted to make it look like light is being bent. This texture is created from a framebuffer, and then the distortion is applied with a normal map.",Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),"One problem I encountered was that the texture included pixels that weren't directly behind the bottle. This also included objects that were in front of the bottle, which shouldn't show up in refraction. To solve this problem I masked the framebuffer texture so that only pixels behind the bottle are used. Then, to make the glass look more realistic I implemented the Fresnel effect. This mixes the diffuse and refraction texture depending on a Fresnel term, which means that for different viewing angles the refraction of the bottle will change - just like in real life.",Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),"To make the demo more immersive, I decided to add some physics, implementing a player class with physics and a hitbox which collides with the world. I chose to implement physics from scratch, wanting to learn how everything is made from the ground up and all the technical detail involved. I used Kasper Fauerby\u2019s paper on capsule collision (capsules being widely used in engines, such as Unity\u2019s engine) which successfully detects and resolves collisions between the player and geometry, relying heavily on vector maths. The collisions are resolved with the player sliding along geometry instead of just getting stuck on it. This also allows for movement up ramps and along walls.",Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),"The final shader that I made was my water shader, which used the same techniques as the clouds shader but modifying the textures to look like water instead of clouds. I quickly made a wave like texture in blender utilising different noise textures mixed together (perlin and voronoi) with some contrast adjustments.",Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),"All the visuals wouldn\u2019t have been possible without some great 3D models I found online, which I also had to modify slightly to get them to work in my OpenGL environment. The clouds, water and glass shaders combined with the pirate ship and bottle models made for a moody environment to showcase my project together with the ability to have the player immersed in the scene with collision and gravity physics. I really enjoyed putting this project together to show how I\u2019m developing my skills and look forward to developing it further as I learn more."]}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsxs)("p",{children:["Credits:",Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),Object(w.jsx)("br",{}),"learnopengl.com - Joey de Vries - https://twitter.com/JoeyDeVriez.
